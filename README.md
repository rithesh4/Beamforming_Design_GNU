Beamforming Implementation and Parametric Analysis (.grc)
This repository hosts a collection of GNU Radio Companion (.grc) flowgraphs implementing various beamforming algorithms along with a structured parametric analysis framework. It is intended for students, researchers, and engineers working in the domains of software-defined radio (SDR), array signal processing, and wireless communications.

🛠️ Prerequisites
Before using the flowgraphs, ensure that you have the following installed:

GNU Radio (v3.8 or later recommended)

GNU Radio Companion (GRC)

Python 3.x environment with required GNU Radio blocks

[Optional] Hardware support for real-time testing (e.g., USRP, RTL-SDR)

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/beamforming-grc.git
cd beamforming-grc
2. Launch GNU Radio Companion
bash
Copy
Edit
gnuradio-companion
3. Open a Flowgraph
Open one of the .grc files using the GUI and review the block parameters and comments for clarity.

4. Configure Parameters
Each flowgraph exposes key parameters such as:

Number of antenna elements

Inter-element spacing

Signal direction (Angle of Arrival)

SNR / noise profile

Beam steering angle

Use the variable blocks to modify these values and observe the system response in the time/frequency domain.

🔬 Use Cases
Simulating beam patterns and array responses

Analyzing beamforming performance under different scenarios

Teaching concepts in spatial filtering and antenna arrays

Prototyping SDR systems for MIMO, radar, and communication stacks

📌 Notes
The base implementations are derived from a CC0-licensed repository and have been significantly modified for enhanced clarity, modularity, and analytical capability.

All files are platform-independent and require only GNU Radio-compatible environments to execute.
